# Practical short-term actions against the Coronavirus

The object of this text is to trigger an effective reaction for the improvement of the non-contagion device and the newspaper Le Monde seems to us to be a place of intelligence and independence of mind, with an important influence

indeed There is a heavy presumption of operational insufficiency of the system for the following reasons

in general, the capacity for implementation and control of government officials does not seem very high: see the non-application of the environmental health plan (William DAB report which Le Monde has reported on)

the government showed by maintaining the municipal elections that it was not aware. of the overall risk it posed to the population (we are constantly seeing political figures at risk and a certain number are contaminated)

at this very moment we hear no information on the essentials of the device, namely the diffusion of masks for situations of potential contamination, nor on the production of masks in very large numbers

this text tries to propose a method to identify the quantitatively most important risk situations, by going into the details of the protection procedures for some situations deemed critical

it is essential at this stage to avoid any contagion, taking into account the modes of transmission and content of potential contacts in the context of a confinement situation but with the maintenance of the activities and contacts necessary for life in a community for 45 days.

modes of transmission

the main known

assimilation of cough expectoration

skin contact

But also probably

reception of "postillions" of words from infected people, but not symptomatic, not coughing.

maybe also contact with the expired air by these same people

contact with contaminated objects where the virus is maintained, it is maintained for example. 24 hours on cardboard and 48 hours on steel


the activities maintained

Â Healthcare.

local food supply, but also the supply chain or even production, since the duration is 45 days

essential network maintenance, water sanitation electricity energy telecommunications, maintenance which may require travel, teamwork and contact with consumers.

all other activities are in principle interrupted but you have to make sure

There is also an activity that accompanies all the activities maintained, it is the transport of people.

All these activities must therefore be organized in a non-contaminating manner.

The quantitatively most important activity in terms of number of contacts is the food supply of consumers.


Let us immediately ask the question of bakeries quite specific to our country.

very frequent contacts: one per day and per household, with frequent words exchanged, an exchange of product from hand to hand and an exchange of physical money.

This activity is difficult to control, it is obviously necessary to equip all the trade personnel with masks. However, direct contact between customers seems impossible to reduce sufficiently. In addition, currency exchanges, even if the merchant is protected, can cause contaminations between the person who gave the currency in payment and the person who receives these same coins in return. The reasonable solution could be to have the bread temporarily distributed by the supermarkets in the context of global supplies, the bakeries maintaining their production and delivering the supermarkets with an accounting record.

For supermarket supplies, you have to maximize your drive.

So it is necessary to solve the problems of computer processing and possibly to process the orders manually in case of computer saturation and for people without Internet access. We can call on staff from the home store freed up by the drive function or hire additional qualified staff if possible.

Then a rigorous procedure is required in the context of contact drive. Pick-up times are organized but to organize zero contagion, for example, the consumer must stay in his car until he arrives at the distribution position. And to avoid contact on this occasion, it is proposed to proceed as follows: the consumer shuts down his engine, opens his trunk and gets back into his car, the attendant, preferably masked and gloved, places the cardboard in the trunk and disinfects the products with an alcohol spray unless disinfection has been provided upstream. Obviously the personnel who constitute the boxes must absolutely be gloved and masked.

In the same way, all persons in the activities maintained must be gloved and masked to avoid bringing contamination back into their families during their activities.

For the transport function, it seems desirable to favor individual transport, for example by family taxi, as soon as a member of the family is available to convoy the person concerned by a sustained activity.
