# Practical short-term actions against the Coronavirus

In this text we attempt to list practical ways to stop the community spread of the coronavirus. Those actions are meant to be easy to implement in practice, within the current logistical constraints in Europe.

Indeed there are good reasons to doubt the capacity of the European governments of handling this crisis:

- in general, the capacity for implementation and control of government officials does not seem very high: see the non-application of the environmental health plan (see the William DAB report which "Le Monde" has reported on).

- the French government showed, by maintaining the municipal elections, that it was not aware of the overall risk it posed to the population (we are constantly seeing political figures at risk and a certain number are contaminated).

- at this very moment we hear no information about most of the actions taken, namely about, the diffusion of masks for situations of potential contamination, or how the production of masks will be scaled to the necessary tens of millions per day.

In here we will address the most common high-risk situations, and go into the details of the protection procedures, not only in the current situation of national quarantine, but also thereafter.

## How does the virus spread ?

- assimilation of coughing expectoration
- direct skin contact
- contact with contaminated objects, 24 hours on cardboard and 48 hours on steel

But also probably:

- assimilation of droplets produced by infected, asymptomatic people spkeaing, not coughing.
- maybe also inhaling  the expired air expired by these same people


## The activities maintained
### Healthcare
### Local food supply, but also the supply chain and even food production, since the virus seems here to stay
### Maintenance of utilities, water, sanitation, electricity, energy, telecommunications, maintenance which may require travel, teamwork and contact with customers.

All other activities are in principle interrupted, although this has to be enforced.
There is also an activity that accompanies all the activities maintained, it is the transport of people.
All these activities must therefore be organized to prevent spreading the disease.

The activity responsible for the most contacts is the distribution of food.

Take the example of French bakeries.
Very frequent contacts: one per day and per household, with chatter, an exchange of product from hand to hand and an exchange of physical cash.
This activity is difficult to control, it is obviously necessary to equip all the trade personnel with masks. However, direct contact between customers seems impossible to reduce sufficiently. In addition, exchange of cash, even if the merchant is protected, can cause contaminations between the person who gave the cash in payment and the person who receives these same coins in return. The reasonable solution could be to have the bread temporarily distributed by the supermarkets, the bakeries maintaining their production and delivering the supermarkets with an accounting record.

For supermarket trips, we have to rely on drive-through.

So it is necessary to solve the problems of computer processing and possibly to process the orders manually in case of computer saturation and for people without Internet access.

Then a rigorous procedure is required for the drive-through itself. Pick-up times must be arranged, but to have zero contagion, the customer must stay in his car until he arrives at the distribution position. And to avoid contact on this occasion, we can do as follows: the customer shuts down his engine, opens his trunk and gets back into his car, the staff member, masked and gloved if possible, places the boxes in the trunk and disinfects the products with an alcohol spray, unless disinfection has been provided upstream. Obviously the personnel who packed the boxes must absolutely be gloved and masked.

In the same way, all persons in the activities maintained must be gloved and masked to avoid bringing contamination back into their families during their activities.

For the transport function, it seems desirable to favor individual transport, for example by family taxi, as soon as a member of the family is available to convoy the person concerned by a sustained activity.
